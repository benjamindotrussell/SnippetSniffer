# SnippetSniffer
Used to find snippets of test code in a src folder.

When I am writing code I surround my code with a comment //Start Test
I can use this program to search though a file system and find any instances of the offending test block so I can deside wether to remove it before checking my code into a repository.

This project uses Java8 and JavaFX in a MVC design patern. But really there is only a VC in this small application.

I desided to write this script after getting haranged by my coworkers for checking in some test code. 

There is plenty of room to further develop this project.
Currently it only searches for files anding in .java
It could be modified to give the user an option for searching for user defined file types.
It could aslo be modified to allow the user to define the text to search for.
